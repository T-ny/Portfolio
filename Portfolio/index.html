									<h2>Background</h2>
									<p>I hail from the beautiful city of Haldwani, nestled in the heart of Uttarakhand, a state renowned for its natural beauty, spiritual significance, and rich cultural heritage. Uttarakhand, often referred to as "Devbhoomi" (Land of the Gods), is home to breathtaking landscapes, including the majestic Himalayan peaks, serene lakes, and dense forests. The state also boasts some of the most revered pilgrimage sites, such as the Char Dham—Yamunotri, Gangotri, Kedarnath, and Badrinath.

										Uttarakhand's vibrant traditions, warm hospitality, and unique cuisine, infused with local flavors, make it a place that captures the heart of anyone who visits. The cultural diversity and the deep spiritual connection of its people with nature are just a few of the reasons why Uttarakhand is so special.
